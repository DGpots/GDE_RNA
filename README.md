# GDE_RNA - R Shiny Visualization App for RNA-seq Data

This repository hosts the code for the RNA-seq visualization project at the Computational Genomics Lab, MD Anderson Cancer Center. It is for demonstration purpose and not under active development. However, it serves as a template for RNA-seq-based visualization applications, and comments are always welcomed.
