# GDE_RNA - R Shiny Visualization App for RNA-seq Data

This repository hosts the code for the RNA-seq visualization project at the Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center. It is only for demonstration purpose and not under active development. However, it may serve as a template for RNA-seq-based visualization applications, and comments are always welcomed.
